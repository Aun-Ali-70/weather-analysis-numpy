# Weather Analysis using NumPy

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that analyzes historical weather temperature data using NumPy.
The project loads temperature data from a CSV file, calculates basic statistics, and predicts the next day's temperature using a moving average.

---

## Features
- Load temperature data from a CSV file
- Calculate average, maximum, and minimum temperature
- Predict next day temperature using moving average
- Simple and clean NumPy-based implementation

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy

## Dataset
The dataset (`temperatures.csv`) contains daily temperature values:

| Day | Temperature (°C) |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | 30 |
| 2  | 31 |
| ... | ... |
